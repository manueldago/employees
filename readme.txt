REQUIREMENT:
************
Program's "UI" would be the following in the console:

Selection:
1. List all employees
2. Give a raise in salary
3. Add employee
4. Quit the application

In selection case 1 , "lists all" employees and give out their name, salary and the salary after tax percentage
for example: Mike Dawson, Builder's union (collective agreement), 25% (tax), +5 year experience. Would end up in salary of 2100dollars
and that 2100 would turn into 1575 after taxes.

In selection case 2 for example: Give a raise function, that gives employee 3% index raise calculated from current salary.

In selection case 3 for example: Function adds new employee into the list with all the properties, like : Name, Salary, Union collective agreement, Tax.

The database can be entirely made up with bogus information that seems relatively real, it has to have 10 employees from which atleast 3 have
Union with the collective agreement regarding pay.
Employee has:
- Firstname and last name
- collective agreement( of the union which he belongs to)
- tax percentage
- addition to salary based by experience : +5 years = salary+5%, +10years = salary+10%.
- If he belongs to union, like builders union, he has base salary which you can determine


You do not have to save employees anywhere permanently, all data is allowed to be lost after quitting the application.
